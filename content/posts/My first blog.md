## The start of a journey

- I'm currently following a networkchuck video, and i think its great! Its showing how to make a blog (web log) easily, i think you need to go check it out: https://youtu.be/dnE7c0ELEH8

## The Startup

- I am now writing the blog, adding all the details that it needs to have, and it looking pretty nice so far.
- I generally want this to be like a tutorial so i I'll start walking you through it, or you can just watch the video both are valid options.

## step 1: Obsidian setup

### Download Obsidian

- You can download obsidian from the following link: https://obsidian.md/download
- Just follow the Setup Wizard and you'll be good to go.

### setting it up

- After successfully installing Obsidian and opening it, you would want to create a folder by clicking the icon shown in the image below:

!![Image Description](/images/1.png)

- after clicking the button a new folder appears, you can name it anything but i named it `posts`
- Now you need to know where these folders are getting stored, you can do that by right-clicking the folder and choosing *show in system explorer* option as shown below:

!![Image Description](/images/2.png)

- That's it for Obsidian for now.
## step 2: set up Hugo
### Install Hugo

#### Prerequisites

- Install Git: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
- Install Go: https://go.dev/dl

#### Install Hugo

link: https://gohugo.io/installation

#### Create a new site

```bash
## Check if Hugo works
hugo version

## Now let's create the website!

hugo new site yourwesitename
cd yourwebsitename
```

#### Download a theme for your Website

- You can choose a theme of your liking in: https://themes.gohugo.io/
- You can follow the instructions on how to download the theme, i recommend you use *git submodule*.
- Switch to your terminal window and make sure you're in your websites directory

```bash
## Initialize a git repo

git init

## Set your global username and email address params for the git repo

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your.emailAddress@example.com"

## Here you're going to install the theme you chose. When its downloaded it should be in your Hugo theme folder
## Search for a theme here --> https://themes.gohugo.io/ I will be installing the terminal theme.

git submodule add -f https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git themes/terminal

```

#### Tweak Hugo's settings

- Nearly all the themes on Hugo have an example configuration you can use. This is a fast and easy way of using Hugo and it usually works out of the box without any hiccups.
- The *Terminal* theme provides the following config example.
- We can edit the *hugo.toml* file inside of your websites folder to make the changes needed. on Linux/MacOs you could do `nano hugo.toml`, on Windows its `notepad hugo.toml` or if you have VSCode you could use `code hugo.toml` which works on all platforms.

```toml
baseurl = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
# Add this script only if you're keeping this theme in the `themes` directory.
# Remove it if you're using the theme as a remote Hugo Module.
theme = "terminal"
paginate = 5

[params]
  # directory name of your main content (default is `content/posts`).
  # the list of set content will show up on your index page (baseurl).
  contentTypeName = "posts"

  # if you set this to 0, only submenu trigger will be visible
  showMenuItems = 2

  # show selector to switch language
  showLanguageSelector = false

  # set theme to full screen width
  fullWidthTheme = false

  # center theme with default width
  centerTheme = false

  # if your resource directory contains an image called `cover.(jpg|png|webp)`,
  # then the file will be used as a cover automatically.
  # With this option you don't have to put the `cover` param in a front-matter.
  autoCover = true

  # set post to show the last updated
  # If you use git, you can set `enableGitInfo` to `true` and then post will automatically get the last updated
  showLastUpdated = false

  # Provide a string as a prefix for the last update date. By default, it looks like this: 2020-xx-xx [Updated: 2020-xx-xx] :: Author
  # updatedDatePrefix = "Updated"

  # whether to show a page's estimated reading time
  # readingTime = false # default

  # whether to show a table of contents
  # can be overridden in a page's front-matter
  # Toc = false # default

  # set title for the table of contents
  # can be overridden in a page's front-matter
  # TocTitle = "Table of Contents" # default


[params.twitter]
  # set Twitter handles for Twitter cards
  # see https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started#card-and-content-attribution
  # do not include @
  creator = ""
  site = ""

[languages]
  [languages.en]
    languageName = "English"
    title = "Terminal"

    [languages.en.params]
      subtitle = "A simple, retro theme for Hugo"
      owner = ""
      keywords = ""
      copyright = ""
      menuMore = "Show more"
      readMore = "Read more"
      readOtherPosts = "Read other posts"
      newerPosts = "Newer posts"
      olderPosts = "Older posts"
      missingContentMessage = "Page not found..."
      missingBackButtonLabel = "Back to home page"
      minuteReadingTime = "min read"
      words = "words"

      [languages.en.params.logo]
        logoText = "Terminal"
        logoHomeLink = "/"

      [languages.en.menu]
        [[languages.en.menu.main]]
          identifier = "about"
          name = "About"
          url = "/about"
        [[languages.en.menu.main]]
          identifier = "showcase"
          name = "Showcase"
          url = "/showcase"
```

### Test Hugo

```bash
## Check if Hugo works with your chosen theme using this command.

hugo server -t themename
```

## The Bridge

**NOTE:** MR.NetworkChuck wrote a script which he referred to as the MEGA SCRIPT that will combine all of these steps into one.

### Uploading your Obsidian file to Hugo

#### Windows

```powershell
robocopy sourcepath destinationpath /mir
```

#### Linux/MacOs

```bash
rsync -av --delete "sourcepath" "destinationpath"
```

#### Adding some preliminaries

#### Transfer images from Obsidian to Hugo

##### Windows

```python
import os
import re
import shutil

# Paths (using raw strings to handle Windows backslashes correctly)
posts_dir = r"C:\Users\chuck\Documents\chuckblog\content\posts"
attachments_dir = r"C:\Users\chuck\Documents\my_second_brain\neotokos\Attachments"
static_images_dir = r"C:\Users\chuck\Documents\chuckblog\static\images"

# Step 1: Process each markdown file in the posts directory
for filename in os.listdir(posts_dir):
    if filename.endswith(".md"):
        filepath = os.path.join(posts_dir, filename)
        
        with open(filepath, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
            content = file.read()
        
        # Step 2: Find all image links in the format ![Image Description](/images/Pasted%20image%20...%20.png)
        images = re.findall(r'\[\[([^]]*\.png)\]\]', content)
        
        # Step 3: Replace image links and ensure URLs are correctly formatted
        for image in images:
            # Prepare the Markdown-compatible link with %20 replacing spaces
            markdown_image = f"![Image Description](/images/{image.replace(' ', '%20')})"
            content = content.replace(f"[[{image}]]", markdown_image)
            
            # Step 4: Copy the image to the Hugo static/images directory if it exists
            image_source = os.path.join(attachments_dir, image)
            if os.path.exists(image_source):
                shutil.copy(image_source, static_images_dir)

        # Step 5: Write the updated content back to the markdown file
        with open(filepath, "w", encoding="utf-8") as file:
            file.write(content)

print("Markdown files processed and images copied successfully.")
```

## Setup Github

- Go to https://github.com/ and sign in/sign up
- Create a repository

### Get an ssh authentication

```bash
## Generate an SSH key (Works on all platforms)

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

### Push everything to github

```bash
# Step 8: Push the public folder to the hostinger branch using subtree split and force push
echo "Deploying to GitHub Hostinger..."
git subtree split --prefix public -b hostinger-deploy
git push origin hostinger-deploy:hostinger --force
git branch -D hostinger-deploy
```
